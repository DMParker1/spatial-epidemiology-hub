# Spatial Epidemiology Hub — Daniel M. Parker

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/DMParker1/spatial-epidemiology-hub)](https://github.com/DMParker1/spatial-epidemiology-hub/releases)

This is my personal umbrella repository tying together projects, tools, and collaborations in GIS, spatial epidemiology, and public health. It is both a **map of my career so far** and a **pointer to where my current and future work is headed**.

Most of my active research is now organized under the [**Parker Group organization**](https://github.com/parker-group), where we develop and share open spatial analysis tools and datasets. For a complete picture of our group’s work, see the [**Public Overview**](https://github.com/parker-group/public-overview).

## 🌍 Career Arc & Project Constellation

### 1. **Foundations** — Field epidemiology & GIS
Early work combining field research, geography (especially geographic reconnaissance), anthropology (ethnography and participant observation), and spatial analyses to understand health and disease in complex settings.

### 2. **Expanding Methods** — Earth Observation, Activity Space & Movement Analysis, and Spatial Modeling
Incorporating **Earth Observation**, **human movement studies**, **spatiotemporal analysis**, and tool development to answer new public health questions.

- [SDEtool](https://github.com/parker-group/SDEtool) — Our in-house R package for generating standard deviational ellipses.  
- [earth-observation-hub](https://github.com/DMParker1/earth-observation-hub) — Remote sensing methods applied to health and the environment.  
- [HumMovPatt](https://github.com/SaiTheinThanTun/HumMovPatt) — Human movement & exposure buffer size selection (DOI: [10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16784.2](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16784.2)).  
- **Raster-Buffer Extractor** — Helper functions to extract **time-series** environmental values from **raster stacks** within **user-defined buffers** around GPS points ([helper functions](https://github.com/CatalinaMedina/aedes-serology/tree/main/helper-functions), DOI: [10.1016/j.actatropica.2023.106829](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2023.106829)).

### 3. **Interdisciplinary Collaborations**
Working at the intersection of epidemiology, vector-borne disease control, climate, and health systems — often in challenging borderland and displacement contexts.

- [METF-mapping](https://github.com/DMParker1/METF-mapping) — Mapping and community engagement groundwork for malaria post placement.  
- [tMDA-program](https://github.com/DMParker1/tmda-program) — Targeted mass drug administration trials and modeling.  
- [early-dx-tx](https://github.com/DMParker1/early-dx-tx) — Early access to malaria diagnosis and treatment.  
- [tm-border-mch](https://github.com/DMParker1/tm-border-mch) — Maternal and child health research on the Thailand–Myanmar border.

### 4. **Current & Future Directions** — Parker Group
Most of my active and upcoming work happens within the **[Parker Group](https://github.com/parker-group)**, where we build open tools and curate datasets.  
For a complete, living catalog see the **[Public Overview](https://github.com/parker-group/public-overview)**.
