# Spatial Epidemiology Hub ‚Äî Daniel M. Parker

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/DMParker1/spatial-epidemiology-hub)](https://github.com/DMParker1/spatial-epidemiology-hub/releases)

This is my personal umbrella repository tying together projects, tools, and collaborations in GIS, spatial epidemiology, and public health. It is both a map of my career so far and a pointer to where my current and future work is headed. 

Most of my active research is now organized under the [**Parker Group organization**](https://github.com/parker-group), where we develop and share open spatial analysis tools and datasets. For a complete picture of our group‚Äôs work, see the [**Public Overview**](https://github.com/parker-group/public-overview).

*Two complementary views: the Project Constellation shows how projects connect; the Timeline shows when they happened and how the methods evolved.*

## üåç Career Arc & Project Constellation

### 1. **Foundations** ‚Äî Field epidemiology & GIS
Early work combining field research, geography (especially geographic reconnaissance), anthropology (ethnography and participant observation), and spatial analyses to understand health and disease in complex settings.

### 2. **Expanding Methods** ‚Äî Earth Observation, Activity Space & Movement Analysis, and Spatial Modeling
Incorporating **Earth Observation**, **human movement studies**, **spatiotemporal analysis**, and tool development to answer new public health questions.

- [earth-observation-hub](https://github.com/DMParker1/earth-observation-hub) ‚Äî EO methods applied to health and the environment.  
- [earth-observation-howto](https://github.com/parker-group/earth-observation-howto) ‚Äî Practical guides for weather stations, ERA5, zonal stats, and raster reshaping.  
- [activity-spaces](https://github.com/DMParker1/activity-spaces) ‚Äî Narrative + code on GPS loggers, mobile data, farm huts, and other exposure spaces.  
- [SDEtool](https://github.com/parker-group/SDEtool) ‚Äî R package for standard deviational ellipses.  
- **Raster buffer extraction** ‚Äî Helper scripts for linking raster time series to GPS points; originally developed in an Aedes exposure study ([functions](https://github.com/CatalinaMedina/aedes-serology/tree/main/helper-functions)).  


### 3. **Interdisciplinary Collaborations**
Working at the intersection of epidemiology, vector-borne disease control, climate, and health systems ‚Äî often in challenging borderland and displacement contexts.

- [METF-mapping](https://github.com/DMParker1/METF-mapping) ‚Äî Mapping and community engagement groundwork for malaria post placement.  
- [tMDA-program](https://github.com/DMParker1/tmda-program) ‚Äî Targeted mass drug administration trials and modeling.  
- [early-dx-tx](https://github.com/DMParker1/early-dx-tx) ‚Äî Early access to malaria diagnosis and treatment.  
- [tm-border-mch](https://github.com/DMParker1/tm-border-mch) ‚Äî Maternal and child health research on the Thailand‚ÄìMyanmar border.

### 4. **Current & Future Directions** ‚Äî Parker Group
Most of my active and upcoming work happens within the **[Parker Group](https://github.com/parker-group)**, where we build open tools and curate datasets.  
For a complete, living catalog see the **[Public Overview](https://github.com/parker-group/public-overview)**.
